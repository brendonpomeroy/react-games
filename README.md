# Games Repository

Welcome to the Games repository! 🎮 This is a collection of small, fun games, built with React and Tailwind CSS. The first game in this repo is Blackjack, and more games will be added as time goes on.

## Current Games

### Blackjack

**Blackjack** is a popular card game where the goal is to have a hand value closest to 21 without going over.

#### How to Play:

The game starts with the player and dealer each receiving two cards.

The player can choose to "Hit" (draw another card) or "Stand" (keep their current hand).

The dealer will reveal cards, and if their total is over 21, the player wins.

If both the player and dealer's totals are under 21, the one closest to 21 wins.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
cd games
npm install
```

Then, run the app:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the app at <http://localhost:3000>.

## Tech Stack

React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

Tailwind CSS: Utility-first CSS framework to style the app.

TypeScript: Superset of JavaScript for type safety.

## Future Additions

This repository is designed to grow over time with more small games! Feel free to submit issues or pull requests for any game ideas or improvements.
